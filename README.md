# PRODIGY_DS_03
# Introduction
In this project, we aim to build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral data. We will utilize the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains information from a marketing campaign conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. This dataset is rich with features such as age, job, marital status, education, and more, which will help in constructing our prediction model.

# Challenges
Imbalanced Data:
The Bank Marketing dataset is known to be imbalanced, with a significant disparity between the number of clients who did subscribe to a term deposit (minority class) and those who did not (majority class). This imbalance can lead to a biased model that favors the majority class, reducing its effectiveness in correctly predicting the minority class.

Handling Categorical Variables:
The dataset contains many categorical variables such as job, marital status, education, and more. These variables need to be converted into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding. This process increases the dimensionality of the dataset, which can pose computational challenges and may require careful handling to prevent overfitting.

Missing Values:
Although the dataset is relatively clean, some features might still have missing values. Proper handling of these missing values is crucial to ensure the robustness of the model. Common techniques include filling missing values with the median or mode, or using more advanced imputation methods.

Overfitting:
Decision trees are prone to overfitting, especially if they are allowed to grow without constraints. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the noise in the training data rather than the actual underlying patterns. This can result in poor generalization to new, unseen data. Pruning the tree or setting maximum depth limits are common methods to mitigate overfitting.

Feature Selection:
Not all features in the dataset may be equally relevant for predicting the target variable. Irrelevant or less important features can add noise to the model and reduce its performance. Feature selection techniques, such as analyzing feature importance scores from the decision tree, can help identify and retain only the most significant features.
